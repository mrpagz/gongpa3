# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at [some examples](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## Task

```
Create  password generator
```

## Requirements

```
Ask the user a series of questions
a) length of password (numeric input)
b) validate length is between 8 and 128.
c) type of characters to include - special characters, uppercase, lowercase, numeric(series of yes/no confirms)
d) Validate the user selected at least one character type.

Any invalid response will terminate password generation and the user must start over.

Once the user has entered valid responses, generate a password that meets their criteria and display it in the box.
```

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
